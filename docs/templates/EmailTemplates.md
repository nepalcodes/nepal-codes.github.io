Hello!

My name is **Your Name**, and I'm one of the members of Nepal Codes. Nepal Codes is a Non-Profit organization. We're building a community of volunteer Nepalese to build software and help other Nepalese worldwide!

We'd love for you to drop by or join a project via this slack invite (https://join.slack.com/t/nepalcodes/shared_invite/zt-8gofmllg-uVoknNg3EZ1GSkWEf982pQ)

Our current projects are:
 - United Nepali: A website for Nepali community organizers and members to share information and events in their area.
 - Coviders: A hackathon to fight COVID-19
 - Badges: A recognition system to award those in our community for excellence in the Learn, Code, and Innovate tracks via open badge certificates.
 - Mentorship Program: A career growth and development program for software engineers and students.

And we're constantly looking for new ideas and new projects. Please join us on slack (https://join.slack.com/t/nepalcodes/shared_invite/zt-8gofmllg-uVoknNg3EZ1GSkWEf982pQ) or send me an email.


Looking forward to hearing from you,
