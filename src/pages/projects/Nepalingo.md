## Description

Nepalingo is a project under Incubate Nepal. Since 1795, 61% of native languages across the world have already been lost, and many of Nepal's 100 indigenous languages have also been identified as at risk. Nepalingo.com aims to help preserve these languages and with them our stories, songs, history, and culture. We take the work of linguists who have already expended great efforts accumulating the knowledge of these languages into dictionaries and make that information easier to learn and remember. In doing so, we hope to help new generations connect with their elders and reconnect with their heritage.
