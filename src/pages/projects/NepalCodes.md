## Description

The Nepal Codes Website functions to inform vistors about the mission of the Nepal Codes non-proft and how they can get involved in the community! The content on the page is managed via several markdown files using a react framework called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) created by the Facebook Open Source group.
